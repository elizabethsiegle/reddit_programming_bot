This Reddit slack bot uses the [Linklater](https://github.com/hlian/linklater) API to return a trending Reddit story (using this [Reddit API](https://github.com/intolerable/reddit)) related to programming, and whatever query you pass. So, /reddit javascript would return a hot JS story from Reddit (including its link, score, and more), and /reddit tennis would return a trending story about tennis from the programming section. To run, clone the repo, *stack build*, *stack exec redditbot*, and then open up a Ngrok tunnel. You'll need a [Slack incoming webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks), too.
